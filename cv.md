## About Me
I took part in the development of the website iso20022.by (https://iso20022.by/), designed the main pages of catalogs and reference books, and her personal account.
After putting it into production, the site was under my supervision.
I wrote a simple admin panel in Angular for this site, in which you could view, change and add news content, information about messages, directories and page hashes.

In addition to developing the website, I took part in internal projects of the company:
- project for the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus, designed the appearance of reports for statistical reporting of the BISS and SMP systems.
- a project for the department of information technology archives, designed the appearance of a web application for recording magnetic tapes.

Currently I am actively studying JS and the React framework.

## Code Examples
Conditions of the problem:
Samwell discovered that his messages were being intercepted and read at Castle Gemini, so his attacks were no longer sudden. After thinking a little, he developed a program that would encrypt transmitted messages using the following algorithm: the program receives a string as input and swaps places in it every 2 consecutive characters. If the length of the string is odd, then the last character remains in its place.
```
const encrypt = (text)  => {
  let length = text.length;
  let i = 0;
  let result = '';
  for (i; i<length; i+=2){
    if (i + 1 >= length){
      result = result + text[i];
    } else{
    result = result + text[i + 1] + text[i];
  }
  }
  return result;
}
export default encrypt;
