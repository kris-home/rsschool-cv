## About Me
I am responsible and purposeful, which helps me to work successfully in a team. For me, the main thing is constant development, so that there would be an opportunity to learn new things, improve the knowledge already gained.
I took many courses on website layout, studied WordPress and Jumla.
At the moment, I am actively engaged in in-depth study of JS and Angular framing.

I have little development experience, I participated in the creation of the iso20022.by website (https://iso20022.by/).
Also, I wrote a simple admin panel in Angular for this site.
At the moment I am still taking part in 2 internal projects of the BMRTS company:
- a project for the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus, I make up the appearance of reports for the statistical reporting of the BISS and SMP systems.
- an internal project of the BMRC for the department of information technology archives, I make up the appearance of a web application for accounting magnetic tapes.
